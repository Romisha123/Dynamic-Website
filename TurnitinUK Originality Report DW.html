INTRODUCTION Rajinda, a party organizer has been working on providing different party services to her customer. From over past two years she is providing all the services over a phone. Arranging all the parties through phone was not too easy so she decided to build her own web-based application. She appointed us to mitigate all the problems by allowing her costumers to book party through online facilities and allow them to check the available parties too. According to Rajinda’s requirement the system should allow customer to register with their personal details including children’s name, birth date and other details. The customer must be able to view all the party details and the total expenses of the party in their local currency. She should be able to add, update and delete the party details. HTML, CSS, PHP and JavaScript will be used to build this web application. For the front-end design HTML and CSS will be used whereas for the back-end, PHP and JavaScript will be implemented. TASK 1 Setup page makes easy to export and import database from the localhost so setup page has been created to create new database. Because of setup page these procedures are possible which contains SQL queries. These queries create database and table. All the data stored previously are inserted into table through SQL queries. TASK 2 Here, the registered users are only allowed to excess all the party services. After doing register general users will be able to book available parties and view party details whereas admin can create, view, update and delete party. TASK 3 In this application, the main objectives of add form is to add all the party details by admin so that general users could view all the party details by logging in their account. Party details include party name, description, cost per child, Length of party, max no of children, services, party images. All the data are inserted to the database by inserted queries. . The currency has been maintained as per the requirement of the application. While booking party date the price per children and total cost get converted in local currencies as user choose their country TASK 4 This online calendar is for the general users. One party is organized in one particular day so it makes easier to book party dates viewing calendar. In these system clients can view available and unavailable party dates. The client can only book party in available date viewing online calendar. TASK 5 In this system only admin(Rajinda) is allowed to update and delete party details after entering her admin dashboard by logging in her account. Administrator can modify details as per her needs and can deleted all the details if no longer in use or needed. TASK 6 This booking availability system has been created to enables parties to be booked by the clients. Only one party is organized in one day so client booked party for only free available date viewing online calendar. And also, email is send to the clients by the admin as soon as party dates has been booked. Screenshot: Email Confirmation Code TASK 7 No costumers like time consuming system so, while booking the party dates the client don’t have to worry about party cost for each particular child. The system will automatically convert total cost of the party (i.e. total cost = cost per child * number of children). TASK 8 It is difficult to make sure about party dates booked by the customer until and unless clients give some advance money to the admin. So, clients should pay some money as advance. online payment system like PayPal system can be used in the system. TASK 9 The whole project is completed using different web development and programing languages like PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery. The implementation of PHP language was more interesting and also came to learn more about front-end designing using Photoshop, HTML and CSS. The whole code was done in sublime. were able to learn about how PHP code works and also about its maintainability and portability. As this whole system and application was developed in short period of time only limited functions and featured are included. Online booking system is far more flexible to compare with phone system. Clients can view party details and can book party as per their needs in any available time but that is not enough. There is still a more function and features to be added for further development or improvement. This current system holds basic functions and tasks. Admin can create, view, update, delete party details and view booked party by clients whereas client can view party details and online calendar and book party according to the available date provided in the calendar. To improve the system many features can be added accessible feature has not been included so it can be added for the differently able people, Update of user profile, Password recovery system. One the user is logged in admin cannot delete the user so this can be added. Some users may forget or get confused their party date due to some busy schedule in this case push notification is very useful so it can be added. And further development includes mailing to the user whose children birthdate is near. All the functionality makes web application user friendly which leads company in the developing phase in future Finally, it was not an easy task to develop whole system in short period of time. We phased many problems in back-end part. online calendar and currency converter was a most difficult task to accomplish. After researching from all the possible ways simple online calendar is added where users can view already booked party dates including year and month. CONCLUSION As a whole, the web application for ChildrenParty4u was successfully done as per the requirement including all the functions and features mentioned above scenario. Now customers can easily book the party date online. Hope we get chance to improve the system further for the betterment of company and costumer.
